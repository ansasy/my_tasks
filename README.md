## introduction
this repo consists of different genres.

i have included arduino projects, python projects, projects on proteus, and C programming projects.
you will find each of them in thier assigned branches

I hope you find this useful :)



## C_Programming
the c programing consists of 4 tasks with rising difficulty.

task 1 is the most simple with using only the print function

task 2 was making a loop to countdown while also using a delay in the process

task 3 was more difficult because it used linked list to make a task manager to add and delete nodes while in runtime

task 4 was the most difficult as it depends on sensor fusion and implementing kalman filter



## arduino
the arduino tasks consisted of 2 tasks

task 1 was about implementing the i2c communication between 2 arduinos

task 2 was about locating the robot location in a map using ultrasonic sensors



## proteus
this genre consisted of 3 tasks

task 1 consisted of 2 parts the first was about stepping down volt and converting it into dc to power up a LED,
the other was a simple mathematical problem on LED's

task 2 was about creating an H-bridge from transistors

task 3 was a mathematical problem on calculating the C-rate of lipo batteries and using it

## python
the python projects consisted of 2 tasks

task 1 was a quite a difficult one using oop in making a game simulation which proved quite difficult

task 2 was about using machine learning and linear regression on a data set and predicting the best possible answer
